        At the beginning of this project, I originally wanted to create a
        sousveillance tool to locate security cameras/CCTVs around the city.
        Then, I spent a lot of time searching for a usable dataset or API but
        could not find one. As a result, I chose to work with other topics that
        were more likely to have open data for me to use. In the end, I found a
        Covid-19 dataset with a free API (https://apidocs.covidactnow.org/). It
        has almost all the Covid-related data in the United States, and it also
        updates on a daily basis. I think this dataset can be an excellent
        material for my sousveillance tool project. If people have better access
        to the Covid data, they can have a more comprehensive understanding of
        the current state of the pandemic. Thus, the public can generate more
        awareness and equip themselves to stop the spread of the virus instead
        of only listening to authorities' suggestions since it was evident that
        they were often unreliable and late to respond with a practical
        direction. I visualized this dataset for my users to easily and quickly
        acknowledge the current state of the pandemic through a glance. The
        squares and circles are color-coded and also have tuned proportions to
        match the numbers that represent. If the users are curious to find out
        the exact numbers of certain data, they can easily do so by placing
        their mouse on the corresponding shapes.

        In this U.S. DAILY COVID-19 REPORT, I packed eight kinds of data that I
        think are most relevant and worth noticing for the general public. They
        are "Daily New Cases," "Daily New Deaths," "Fully Vaccinated Number,"
        "Infection Rate," "Total Cases," "Total Deaths," "Hospital Beds
        Occupied," and "ICU Beds Occupied." The users can quickly grasp
        information by the sizes of those colored shapes and their proportions
        with each designated block. Circles represent the data that refreshes
        daily, such as "Daily New Cases" and "Daily New Deaths." Rectangles
        represent data that are cumulative or do not change drastically on a
        daily basis, such as "Total Cases" and "Total Deaths." Besides, I
        include the exact numbers for each data as well. This function is
        prepared for those who are curious or more sensitive to numbers rather
        than shapes. The users can easily access the exact number of each data
        by placing their mouse on the corresponding shapes.
