        Description
      </h1>
      <p>
        I created this camera filter for virtual meeting platforms, such as
        Zoom. I remember that in Major Studio, my professor, my classmates, and
        I once talked about this phenomenon of people not wanting to turn on
        their cameras in a Zoom meeting. We discussed some potential reasons,
        and I brought up a point saying that the different power dynamics of
        looking made people feel vulnerable. Since in the real world, people can
        easily acknowledge if someone is looking at them. In that case, people
        can choose to follow that line of sight or avoid it. However, in a Zoom
        environment, people cannot naturally detect that line of sight. This
        particular psychology may bring us insecurity because we feel exposed to
        all the attention that we don't have control of. Therefore, I designed
        this camera filter to help people cope with that fear of turning on
        their cameras. The filter is functional in a way that it blocks unwanted
        lines of sight while letting your teachers and peers see your presence
        and attention to the course content. Besides, I provided options for
        people to choose different Emojis to express their feeling or thoughts
        towards the class. As a result, blocking our faces won’t hinder our
        class participation.

        Design Process
      </h1>
      <p>
        I utilized the facial recognition example that was given under the
        assignment description. By altering the line tracings of the face into a
        solid mask, I got this basic model of facial covering. Then, I used
        createRadio() to map out multiple options for the user to choose
        whatever Emojis that could represent their moods. Besides, the Emojis
        they choose can also follow the position of their faces. By having those
        options to express emotions, this camera filter can not only protect the
        user from unwanted attention but also be practical to show students'
        engagment in the class.

        Reflection

      <p>
        I really like this assignment since it let me explore privacy issues
        within technology. Since the feedback loops for attention are so
        different in the digital world, I think we need to come up with tools
        that can help us overcome some of those disconnections and discomforts.
        In my camera filter, I was able to turn a facial recognition camera that
        was supposed to tell more information than a normal camera into a tool
        that only gives out the information that we are willing to give out.
        This project makes me think about a lot more scenarios that we can alter
        technology to become more selective and humanistic.
