        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        I remember playing a game of "You draw, I guess" with my childhood friends. It was a game that one person would think of a random object and tell the next person what the object was. Then, the second would have to draw the object on paper and pass the drawing to the third person. After that, the third person would have to guess what that object was. Of course, we were very young and did not know much about drawing. As a result, my friends and I did not get many correct answers since most information was lost in communication. 
        As I grew up, I became more proficient in drawing til a point that "You draw, I guess" is no longer challenging when I am the drawer. However, I never imagined playing the same game with codes. Now, I feel like I am sent back to square one.

        The description I was given is the following from Nina:
      <p>  
        Object: shirt my brothers gave me
        <li>- It was a short sleeved crop top.
        <li>- The middle part was tan.
        <li>- One sleeve was light pink, and the other was yellow.
        <li>- The hem of the collar was cobalt blue.
        <li>- Centered on the front of the shirt were the words: "happy when it rains" in all lowercase.
        <li>- The text was black and in italics.

        Nina's description is very clear and straightforward. Also, the object itself is not complicated. 
        At first, I started with a quick sketch of what I think the crop top would look like. However, I quickly noticed some difficulties. 
        I do not have any information on the silhouette of the shirt. What was the style of the sleeves? What about the collar?
        I figured that I could not get every detail right unless I was extremely lucky. Therefore, I went with my instincts. 
        I pictured an ordinary crop top and combined it with the known details. The design was simple, although the actual coding was quite
        challenging. Since I did not have much knowledge on coding, I had to watch multiple tutorials and constantly go back to the reference page. 
        During this slow process of practicing, I started to understand things bit-by-bit. In terms of the final result, I tried to make it look 
        clean and simple. When it came to certain shapes that were relatively complex, I found some creatively ways, such as masking, to achieve their looks.
        Although the journey was not easy for me, I still found it quite intriguing and gained a sense of achievement.
