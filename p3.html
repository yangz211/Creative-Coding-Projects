        Description

      <p>
In this project, I want to take a very sentimental and personal approach to explore time as a bond between me and my loved ones. I visualized the time that my mom, dad, girlfriend and I spent in this world. Hence it is more clear to see the relation between our ages under a one-hundred-year scale. To explain how my clocks should be viewed, from the outside in, each circle/half circle represents years, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds. When the mouse is pressed, the names of each person will be displayed.

        Design Process
      </h1>
      <p>
The design looks relatively minimalistic, although I put a lot of thoughts into some design choices, such as shapes and colors. I chose to work with circles because they symbolize inclusiveness and also work well with my intention of creating layers with different time units. The color I selected for each clock also relates to some of my personal impressions towards the corresponding person.

        Reflection

      <p>
      From the process of making this project, I feel like I am deeply connected with the people I love. Although we are not physically together, we are always in a emotional bond. To visualize the time that we spent in this world, I feel a great impact that makes me realize how fast time has passed by, and how short lives actually are. There is a strong urge for me to cherish every memory and experience that I share with them.
