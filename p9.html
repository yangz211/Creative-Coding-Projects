        I made this Consentful Interface to let my user decide whether they want
        to interact with my camera filter. Through this interface, people can
        firstly make choices if they wish to read more about my project. Then,
        if they want to read more, I will display a detailed description of my
        camera filter, including my intentions, ways to use it, and the creator
        of the original facial recognition, etc. After that, people can choose
        to continue or go back to the title page based on their interests. If
        they are still interested in using my camera filter, the next page will
        take them to a list of consent to make sure that they truly
        understand what they are consenting to and the risks that come with it.
        If all boxes are checked, the user can proceed to the next page and
        start using the camera filter.

        In this project, I made sure that by designing this consentful
        interface, I hit all the critical points of the F.R.I.E.S. model, which
        are Freely given, Reversible, Informed, Enthusiastic, and Specific. I
        provided all the possible choices to my users and did not force any
        outcome. I made sure that each step that my users took could be undone.
        The interface displays all the related information in concise language.
        The users' can choose whether they want to proceed or not completely
        based on their interests. I also ensured that the consents that were
        asked were fully accurate and specific to this camera filter. I think
        this assignment provided me a great experience of designing with care. I
        personally had a lot of problems with Google's methods of acquiring
        users' consent. I don't think Google is completely honest when they try
        to get our consent. Or they are not paying the effort to transform
        hard-to-read consent forms into understandable words. Both situations
        result in the consent being null since the user never truly knows what
        they are consenting to. Therefore, in this project, I made sure to keep
        my personal experience in mind and focused on the details and usability
        of a practical consentful interface. Besides, the F.R.I.E.S. model
        helped me keep my eyes on what is truly crucial in acquiring consent.
        Overall, I feel that we are powerful and privileged to be able to design
        in digital space. This medium is really an essential part of people's
        lives, and we can make the world a better place by providing them with
        user interfaces that are ethical and comfortable to use.
