        Project Proposal

      <p>
        I want to make a game that can reflect something that has happened
        recently in my life. However, I do not want the game to be a serious
        adaptation. I want to have a game that feels whimsical and can make my
        players chuckle while playing. Since I just learned how to use voice
        recognition in p5.js., I really want to incorporate voice command into
        my game as one of the main interactions. I think letting the players use
        their voices to interact with the game will definitely add another layer
        of intuitiveness. I imagine it will be so much more interesting and
        experiential than only having the players input with mouse and keyboard
        since I think mouse and keyboard only provide a very robotic interaction
        which can take away lots of the whimsical quality of my game.

        Essentially, this is a reaction game, and you are playing as my laptop.
        You are observing me through the front-facing camera of my laptop. When
        you see me procrastinating and not writing my paper, you have to shout
        at me to stop my procrastination so that I can finish writing the essay
        before a time limit. For example, when you see me gaming, simply say,
        "No Gaming!" and I will stop gaming and go back to writing. The goal is
        to keep the time I spend procrastinating minimal so that I can finish
        the paper as soon as possible and sleep early that night.

        The ideation phase of the game was relatively quick. I have a clear goal
        in mind: to make a game that feels unorthodox compared to a "normal"
        "WASD" walking game. I developed the storyline and the looks within the
        first week of this assignment. However, the journey of transferring
        certain interactions and effects from my imagination into p5 codes was
        extremely difficult. From the most simple task of creating a randomized
        image-swapping machine to a more complex interaction of performing
        feedback for detected voice inputs, nothing was easy. Whenever I thought
        I understood the logic and got the code correct, I was really excited to
        run the game. Unfortunately, in 99 out of 100 cases, I would receive
        something that was totally bugged. So I just kept trying different
        things, such as adding a "=" here, putting an "else if" there, or moving
        a statement from function setup() to function draw(). However, I rarely
        saw my attempts succeed. Sometimes, I could spend an entire day trying
        to make my game perform a very basic action, and I would still be stuck
        at the same place by the end of that day. I did ask my classmates and
        tutors for help, and they could often solve my problems very quickly by
        simply pointing out that I should've used ">=" instead of "==" in a part
        of the code. This made me even more frustrated since I spent so much
        time trying so many different solutions and failed to find the answer.
        Moreover, the answer often appeared to be some very random things that I
        couldn't figure out why they were there. By the end of this assignment,
        I felt very lost and exhausted. I couldn't distinguish what was correct
        or wrong to put into a code. I felt that if I was lucky, anything I
        wrote could execute perfectly. If I am unlucky, everything I wrote could
        be a bug, no matter how hard I tried to fix it. Coding to me felt so
        random and unpredictable.
