        For this assignment, I experimented with the Traditional Chinese Water
        Pattern. I took out the blue arcs/curves as visual elements and
        rearranged them in a circular layout. I played around the position and
        spacing between each shape and made them move or rotate at a certain
        pace to create an optical illusion. In the end, I adjusted the speed of
        their movements. I encountered this unexpected phenomenon which makes it
        hard to see or decide whether the shapes are rotating clockwise or
        counterclockwise.

      <p>
        To me, this assignment feels completely different from the previous
        ones. Since I think in the previous assignments, I felt like I was
        complicating the process of sketching and design using code. I felt like
        I could make things, especially drawings, in other softwares, such as
        Illustrator and Photoshop, much more easily and efficiently. Maybe it
        was because I was not proficient in p5.js., I found the whole process of
        transfering an idea or sketch into p5 very tedious and frustrating. It
        was really hard to precisely make things into what I wanted them to be.
        However, the assignment gave me a completely different experience since
        it was really easy to generate patterns using "for loop". I could also
        adjust the pattern very quickly, thus, I have more room to experiment
        with layouts. This process seems to be much more efficient than drawing
        out the pattern in Illustrator and trying to adjuct there. As a result,
        I am happy to learn this method of drawing using codes. Moreover, I am
        also surprised that I created an optical illusion by "accident." In
        general, this assignment feels very satisfying and rewarding.
